Exhibit JS

Exhibit JS is a React-based web app that allows users to explore and view artifacts and collections from two renowned museums: the Science Museum Group (SMG) and The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The MET). Users can search, filter, view details of items, and save their favorite artifacts for later reference.

- Search and Filter: Easily search and filter items based on different criteria such as title, description, or category
- Item Details: View detailed information about an artifact, including images, descriptions, and more
- Save Favorites: Save items to a personal collection for easy access later
- Museum Switching: Toggle between the Science Museum Group's collection and The MET's collection with two simple buttons on the home page

Technologies used:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: For navigating between different pages in the app.
- CSS: For styling and layout.
- Science Museum Group API: Provides access to the Science Museum Group's collection, allowing users to search through over 500,000 exhibits in the country
